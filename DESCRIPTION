Package: EpiDISH
Title: Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample-Heterogeneity
Version: 2.14.0
Description: EpiDISH is a R package to infer the proportions of a
        priori known cell-types present in a sample representing a
        mixture of such cell-types. Right now, the package can be used on DNAm 
        data of whole blood, generic epithelial tissue and breast tissue. 
        Besides, the package provides a function that allows 
        the identification of differentially methylated cell-types and their 
        directionality of change in Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.
